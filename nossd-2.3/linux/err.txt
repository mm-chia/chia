./client: No GPU name given

Usage
  ./client -d <path> [-d <path>] [-a <address>] [other options]

Main options:
  -a <address>    chia address for reward, can be omitted to disable mining
  -d <path>       directory where plots and temporary files will be stored (required),
                  optionally includes size, plot count and file type limitations
                    -d[,<size>][,<count>N][,[~]<types>][,r] <path>
                  where <size> should be specified with one of the following suffixes:
                    B, KB, MB, GB, TB (bytes, kibibytes, mebibytes, etc)
                  <types> is a set of letters defining file types that are allowed
                  or disallowed (if ~ is used) in this directory:
                    t - temporary files
                    p - plots
                  [,r] - to define read-only directory for mining only
                  option -d can be used multiple times:
                    -d,t <path1> -d,4TB <path2> -d,1TB,p <path3> -d,r <path4>
  -c <level>      compression level (10-15) for new plots (default is 10)
  -m <size>       amount of RAM to use during plotting or finalization
  -w <name>       worker name displayed on the website
  -v, -vv. -vvv   enable verbose program output
  -s <path>       directory to store profile and settings
                  specify current directory "." to make client portable
                  you can run the client from readonly or nonpersistent file system
                  but profile should always be located in
                  a writable persistent directory
                  (default is $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/NoSSDChiaPool)
  -g <gpu_card_index> or <gpu_card_name>
                  set mining GPU
  -x <gpu_card_index> or <gpu_card_name>
                  set plotting GPU
                  <gpu_card_name> can be any part of a name or a serial number,
                  optionally includes memory size limit,
                    -g[,<size>] <name>
                  where <size> can be specified with one of the following suffixes:
                    KB, MB, GB, TB (kibibytes, mebibytes, etc)
                  option -x can only be used once, -g can be used multiple times:
                    -g,5G 2080 -g,8G 3070 -x 4090
  --no-mining
                  disable mining, has the same effect as omitting -a option
  --no-plotting
                  do not make new plots
  --no-gpu-mining
                  disable GPU mining
  --no-gpu-plotting
                  disable GPU plotting
  --no-stop
                  do not stop plotter when run out of space
                  and continue plotting as soon as empty space freed up

Maintenance and benchmark:
  --check-plots
                  test all plots for errors on startup
  --no-benchmark
                  do not run benchmark on startup
  --emulate-filter <256 or 128 or 64 or 32>
                  emulate smaller plot filter to test performance,
                  this option also change benchmark estimations

Fine performance tuning:
  --no-temp
                  do not use temp files, this mode requires 104-120 GB RAM 
  --no-rescan
                  do not scan directories for new plots after startup
  --rescan-interval <seconds>
                  set interval between directories scanning to this value
  --low-priority
                  lower mining threads priority
  --p-threads <count>
                  number of plotting and finalization threads
  --m-threads <count>
                  number of mining threads
  --r-threads <count>
                  number of read threads, increase it for a high latency storage

Network protocol and updates:
  -u <policy>     automatic update policy:
                    0 - turn automatic updates off
                    1 - critical updates only (protocol changes, etc)
                    2 - security updates
                    3 - performance improvements
                    4 - any new version (default)
  -4 -6           use IPv4 or IPv6 (by default both are used)
  --no-ntp
                  do not check system clock

Delegated plotting:
  -p [password]   password used for delegated plotting
                  if "-p" is specified without password,
                  it will be asked at program startup
  -k <publickey>  public key used for delegated plotting
                  new plots will be generated for this public key
  --skip-test
                  embed secret keys into plots with public keys without testing

Example:
  ./client -d,1TB /mnt/plot_storage1 -d /mnt/plot_storage2 -a xch1...ejh
  ./client -d,t /tmp -d,~t /mnt/plot_storage -a xch1...ejh
